            Technology fascinates me! The kind of things code can do is amazing!
            In my high school I was a biology student. I had not worked with
            computers until I took Computer Engineering at VIT, Vellore back in
            2016. From there on, I never looked back. From solving simple puzzle
            kind of coding problems to building products that people use, I have
            come a long way and look to learn much more! I am currently working
            on a project called "Juncture".

            I primarily work on Web and tablet-potrait development. I love the
            way distributed systems gossip with each other and solve problems
            together. I involve in architecting and designing systems and
            looking to explore more in this space. Big fan of the book{" "}
            <i>"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"</i>.<div></div>
